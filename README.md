## Application fact sheet
This is an application is designed for the licensed premises, namely IvanPub, selling alcohol and bar snacks.  This application provides the ability for a customer to order drinks and snacks along with an admin user to enter the details of drinks and snacks for sale.  The design of this application is based on the following nine user stories to provide the basic requirements:
1.	A customer would like to order a drink/snack.
1.	A customer would like to view what he/she has ordered.
1.	A customer would like to add drink/snack to his/ her current order.
1.	A customer would like to cancel my order for a drink/snack.
1.	An admin would like to enter details of the drinks/snacks for sale.
1.	An admin would like to read the details of the drinks/snacks for sale.
1.	An admin would like to view a customer’s order(s).
1.	An admin would like to edit the details of the drinks/snacks for sale.
1.	An the admin would like to withdraw a drink/snack from sale.

This is a minimum viable product (MVP) but not a full system.  Only the above user stories provided above are implemented.  The following three aspects are outside of the scope of the system:
1.	Payments that the customer paying for their order is not required.
1.	Delivering the order that the customer receiving their order is not required.
1.	Other users that no other user stories for other users are required.

### FIVE key features
